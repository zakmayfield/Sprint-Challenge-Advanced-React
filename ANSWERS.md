- [ ] Why would you use class component over function components (removing hooks from the question)?
        When using a class component you get access to lifecycle hooks

- [ ] Name three lifecycle methods and their purposes.
        render(),
        componentWillMount(),
        componentDidMount()

- [ ] What is the purpose of a custom hook?
        To prevent us from writing the same logic more than once, they are reusable hooks that take inputs and return outputs that are customized, so you don't have to write the same hooks over and over again

- [ ] Why is it important to test our apps?
        There are a few reasons including:
        Surfaces bugs faster.
        Allows us to trust the code.
        Acts as a safety net when making changes or refactoring.
        Acts as documentation for the code.
        Encourages us to write more testable code.
